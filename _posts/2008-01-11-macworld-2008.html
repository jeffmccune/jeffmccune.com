I haven't posted in awhile, mainly because I've been preoccupied with a relatively long and relaxing vacation over the winter break where I largely ignored all things technology.

I've been preparing for Macworld 2008, where Nigel Kersten and I will be presenting some demonstrations and technical details about our respective <a href="http://www.reductivelabs.com/projects/puppet/">Puppet</a> deployments at Google and Ohio State University.

If you'll be attending Macworld, feel free to follow <a href="http://twitter.com/jmccune">my Twitter feed</a>.  I don't post much at the moment, though I believe it'll really come in handy during the fast and furious pace of a week long conference like Macworld.

Some other links for gratuitous self promotion:
