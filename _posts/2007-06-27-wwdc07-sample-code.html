I've posted some sample code relating to my presentation on <a href="http://puppet.reductivelabs.com/" title="Puppet">Puppet</a> at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/" title="World Wide Developer Conference">WWDC 2007</a>.  At the moment, there's just a couple of small examples to get started.  I've posted them over in the <a href="https://svn.northstarlabs.net:8443/svn/northstarlabs/trunk/puppet/wwdc07/">repository</a>.  The examples demonstrate how I use puppet to manage the <a href="http://macenterprise.org/content/view/137/140/" title="Firmware Password">firmware password</a> a <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301446" title="Login Hooks">login hook</a>, and install apple packages wrapped inside DMG images.

To get everything I'm working on related to puppet:
<blockquote>svn co https://svn.northstarlabs.net:8443/svn/northstarlabs/trunk/puppet/</blockquote>
If you're interested in more examples, please <a href="/feed/atom" title="Atom Feed">subscribe</a>, as I'm in the process of refactoring a monolithic configuration into smaller, sharable <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/trac/puppet/wiki/PuppetModules" title="Puppet Modules">modules</a>.  I intend to publish more Mac OS X specific modules which should just "drop into" an existing puppet infrastructure as I continue to iron out the process.

Also, please make sure to visit Puppet's author, Luke Kanies site at <a href="http://reductivelabs.com/" title="Reductive Labs">http://reductivelabs.com/</a>  There's a wealth of information about Puppet.  The wiki is constantly growing with new information.
