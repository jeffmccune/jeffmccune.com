<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/jing.png" alt="Jing" align="right" height="96" width="96" />I've been using a relatively new application called Jing to create nice looking flash screen-casts. The application is currently free (as in beer), runs on Mac and Windows, and allows me to quickly convey the exact problem I'm working on.  My only gripe so far is that it doesn't work at all with network homes.  I've filed a bug, hopefully they fix it soon.

I think I'm also going to have my students re-do some of our more tedious documentation, like our rather long <a href="https://www.math.ohio-state.edu/wiki/support/services/email/setup_thunderbird_imap#detailed_procedure" title="OSU Math Thunderbird Setup Guide" target="_blank">Thunderbird setup guide</a>, using a screencast instead of screenshots.

I've also used <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/" title="vnc2swf" target="_blank">vnc2swf</a>, but Jing is far easier to work with.
