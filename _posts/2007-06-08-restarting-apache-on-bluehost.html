I have a dedicated IP address on a shared hosting server from <a href="http://bluehost.com">bluehost.com</a>.  This setup is working well for me; my goal is to run a subversion server with public http and https access, authenticated users for commit access, Trac project management, and a blog.  The only issue I've really run into is bluehost binds to port 80 and 443 with their virtualhost apache server, so even though I have a dedicated IP, these ports are already bound.  As a result, I simply run the subversion server on an alternate port.

Sometimes, however, my custom build of Apache would die off and the subversion server would be down.  I wrote a small bash script and configured my bluehost account to execute this script fairly frequently to make sure apache is always running.  A bit dirty, but it works.  If you running a similar setup, you may be interested in the apache restart script.

The script is: <a href="https://svn.northstarlabs.net:8443/svn/northstarlabs/trunk/website/scripts/check_httpd.sh" title="check_httpd.sh">check_httpd.sh</a>.
