<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/text-mate1.png" alt="Text Mate" height="96" width="96" align="right"/>I quickly noticed that the "mate" command line tool does not work as expected under GNU Screen on Leopard.  The error I get is:

<pre class="code">mate: failed to establish connection with TextMate.</pre>

I suspect this is a side-effect of the Leopard sandbox feature.  I've found a quick shell alias to be a nice work-around:

<pre class="code">alias mate='open -a TextMate.app'</pre>

This works inside of GNU Screen, where the mate command line utility does not.
