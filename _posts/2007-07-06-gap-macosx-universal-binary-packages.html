<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/package.png" alt="Package" align="right" height="96" width="96" />I received a request to deploy <a href="http://www-gap.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/" title="Gap">Gap</a> (Groups, Algorithms, Programming - a System for Computational Discrete Algebra).  The installation process is a bit involved, so these packages might help, as they work well with Apple Remote Desktop.  This package places gap at /usr/local/gap4r4 and places the executable at /usr/local/bin/gap  The package does not modify the PATH, so you'll have to manage that yourself.

The package is: <a href="/pub/osx/pkgs/gap/Gap-4.4.9-1.dmg" title="Gap-4.4.9-1.dmg">Gap-4.4.9-1.dmg</a>
