Needless to say, the server wasn't actually running for any length of time, but I found the following strace command immensely helpful in figuring out the problem.

<pre class="code">
  strace -o /tmp/httpd.strace -ff /usr/sbin/httpd
</pre>

Because apache spawns a number of children, strace with -ff attaches to each child and recorded the system calls in /tmp/httpd.strace.$PID

As it turns out, I was receiving the following error in the child processes:

<pre class="code">
    bind(5, {sa_family=AF_INET, sin_port=htons(443), sin_addr=inet_addr("0.0.0.0")}, 16) \
    = -1 EADDRINUSE (Address already in use)
</pre>
