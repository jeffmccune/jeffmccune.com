<img align="right" class="right" width="96" src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/crystal-tux-rt_thumb.png" alt="Tux" height="116" />Over the past few months, I've been getting fed up with stability issues plaguing my <a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a> based Linksys WRT54GS v2.0 router.  Wireless under OpenWRT was very unreliable, often cutting out in the recent version of White Russian I was running.

Based on the advice of a friend, I've re-flashed my firmware to <a href="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</a> v23 SP2, and I must say, I'm quite impressed.  The Web interface is very slick and clean, UPnP is working out of the box, QoS is present and configurable, though I haven't tested it very much yet, the web interface allows SSH public keys to be configured easily, and stores them in NVRAM variables, and my dynamic DNS host name is also easily configured through the web interface.

All in all, I'm finding DD-WRT to be much more developed and polished than OpenWRT.  I'll comment on this post after a week or so in the event I have stability issues.
