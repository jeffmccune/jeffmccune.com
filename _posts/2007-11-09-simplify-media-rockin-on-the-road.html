Enter <a href="http://www.simplifymedia.com/">Simply Media</a> a free, small application which does just as the name promises.

My iTunes library back home just shows up in my shared iTunes listing, regardless of where I am.  No firewall hackery, nothing to configure, it just works, and works well.

The iTunes integration is fantastic.
