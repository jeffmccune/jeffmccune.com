I've mentioned <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/">screen</a> to a few people, and they've asked me to post my ~/.screenrc file so they might get a quick example of how it works.

If you haven't used screen before, it's a way to run multiple shells within a single virtual terminal.  It's also wonderful if you frequently log into a remote machine and get disconnected or put your machine to sleep.  Screen will keep your programms running and attached to a TTY on the remote end, allowing you to SSH back in and simply resume right where you left off.  This is even easier and quicker when used with kerberized or public key SSH authentication.

My personal screen configuration is located here: <a href="https://svn.northstarlabs.net:8443/svn/northstarlabs/trunk/personal/screen/_screenrc">~/.screenrc</a>
