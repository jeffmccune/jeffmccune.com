<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/twitterrific.png" alt="Twitterrific" class="right" align="right" height="96" width="96" />I've been aware of <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> for some time, and have formed my own opinion of the service without ever actually trying it.  I decided this was a bit rash, so I've signed up to give it a whirl.

I'm <a href="http://twitter.com/jmccune">jmccune</a> on twitter, so follow or let me know if you're a veteran and I should follow you.

I'm a bit skeptical about the value of twitter, from a productive or entertaining view, but I have the suspicion that it'll really shine when I travel for conferences with other twitterers.  Efficient ways to locate watering holes are always welcome.

If anyone has any particularly insightful uses of Twitter, please comment.

I've already stumbled across a few interesting tidbits tracking keywords of interest to me...
