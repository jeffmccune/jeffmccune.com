<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/puppet_96.png" alt="Puppet" height="96" width="96" align="right" class="right"/>Nigel has posted slides from our Macworld 2008 presentation on Puppet.

Please see: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/puppet-mw08/">Puppet Macworld 2008 Project</a>

I'll post additional information once I find out the details of distribution of any audio/video recordings taken during the presentation.
