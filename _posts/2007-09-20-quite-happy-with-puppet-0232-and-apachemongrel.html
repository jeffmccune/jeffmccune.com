I'm very happy with the results.  Performance seems to be much better with Apache handling SSL, and I haven't seen any connections being dropped yet.  I'm also happy to take advantage of some of the new features in 0.23.x.

I've posted a complete and short apache configuration on the Puppet wiki which should help you quickly setup apache as an SSL front end for a cluster of puppetmaster mongrels.
