More specifically, <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> and the widely used <a href="http://www.jeroenwijering.com/?item=JW_FLV_Player">JW FLV Player</a>, among others, all appear to be derivatives of this method.

The article, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/flashsatay">"Flash Satay: Embedding Flash While Supporting Standards"</a> by Drew McLellan has been an excellent source of information while working on my problem of streaming ISO standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_14">MPEG-4 Part 14</a> content directly from my own website.

Overall, I've found a single &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag is sufficient to support both RSS syndication and embedded flash video in a standards-compliant manner.  The trick is to simply nest an &lt;a&gt;&lt;img&gt; tag inside the object tag.  Google Reader will strip the object tag, leaving it's children intact.  This results in a static image being displayed when reading the syndication, along with a hyperlink back to the original article and the streaming video.
