<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/fusion.png" alt="VMWare Fusion" align="right" height="96" width="96" />I haven't posted in awhile, but I was pleased with the results of this small hack.  I booted VMWare Fusion on my Leopard workstation, and was disappointed that the keyboard doesn't work on the console, so I couldn't run ifconfig to look at it's dhcp assigned IP address.  I run vmware machines in NAT mode, so I couldn't look at my dhcp server logs either.

The following shell script did the trick nicely.  I went about my business, and eventually my computer spoke; "128 is up." which allowed me to ssh in.
<pre class="code">
X=2
while [ $X -lt 255 ]
do
  ping -c 1 -t 1 172.16.90.$X 2&gt;/dev/null &gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; (echo $X: Up; say "$X is up") || echo $X: DOWN
  ((X++))
done</pre>
You may find this useful for locating machines if you don't have nmap installed.
