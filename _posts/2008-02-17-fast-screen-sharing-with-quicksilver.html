Many people have two Mac's these days, particularly owners of the MacBook Air, and screen sharing makes it incredibly convenient to access a machine in another room.

As with most things I do frequently, Quicksilver has utterly spoiled me.  The process of making the Finder active, pressing Command+K, and selecting or typing vnc://champ.local is just way too long.

Fortunately, it's really easy to integrate Screen Sharing into our Quicksilver workflow.

Here's how.

You'll need to edit unix plaintext files, rather than rich text which TextEdit.app seems to insist on producing.  <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> is a great, free, text editor for editing Unix plain text files, although I'm partial to <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>.

First, make sure Screen Sharing is turned on in the Sharing Preference Pane in Leopard.

Suppose you want to connect to a machine named "champ" in the Sharing Preference Pane.

The script will have the contents:
<pre class="code">
#!/bin/sh
# Nice and short
open vnc://champ.local &
</pre>

Save the script into ~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Scripts/champ.sh and make sure that folder is scanned by Quicksilver.

You'll also need to make sure the script is executable, so open up Terminal.app and change the permissions:

<pre class="code">
chmod a+x ~/"Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Scripts/"*.sh
</pre>

That's it.  Now you should just be able to invoke Quicksilver, start typing the name of the machine you want to share the screen with, and presto!  Nice and fast.
