<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/terminal.png" alt="Terminal" height="96" width="96" align="right" class="right"/>I've been using the find command for over a decade now, and I'm ashamed to say I never really learned how to properly exclude directories.  Dealing with with subversion working copies that litter ".svn" folders everywhere, I finally sorted it all out this afternoon.

To exclude ".svn" folders and all contents:
<pre class="code">
$ find . '!' '(' -name '.svn' -prune ')'
</pre>

This, combined with find -print0 and xargs -0 to execute arbitrary commands on every filesystem object found is a wonderful tool to keep handy.
