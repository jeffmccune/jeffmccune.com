<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/keychain-unlocked.png" alt="Keychain Unlocked" align="right" height="96" width="96" />I tried retrieving the password for a wireless network I'd joined sometime in the past.  To do this, I went into Keychain Access, selected the System keychain, and asked it to Show Password for the networking in question.

As it turns out, the system keychain is protected with a shared secret which I believe is maintained in /var/db/SystemKey.  This is a binary file, so it's not very easy to pull out the password in a form that can be entered in the dialog box Keychain Access presents.

As a work around, I found a nice hint [1] that uses Keychain Scripting to copy the password to the clipboard.  Here's the Apple Script I'm using.  Please not that the first character of a WEP key appears to be $, which should be discarded.

<pre class="code">
display dialog "What key?" default answer ""
set theKeyName to the text returned of the result
tell application "Keychain Scripting"
	tell keychain "System.keychain"
		set theKeyList to every key
		repeat with k in theKeyList
			if the name of k is theKeyName then
				set TheKeyValue to the password of k
			end if
		end repeat
	end tell
end tell

set the clipboard to TheKeyValue

display dialog "Copied " & length of TheKeyValue & " chars to clipboard." with icon note buttons {"OK"} default button "OK"
</pre>
