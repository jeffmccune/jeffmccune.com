This is a real quick one.  I noticed uuidgen under linux produces lower case strings, while it's Mac OS X counterpart produces uppercase strings.  I generate UUID's for the certificate CN field in Puppet, so I wanted them to match.

This one-liner did the trick nicely.

<pre class="code">
uuidgen | ruby -pe '$_.upcase!'
</pre>
