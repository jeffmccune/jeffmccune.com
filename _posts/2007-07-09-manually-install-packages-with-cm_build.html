<img src="http://northstarlabs.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/package.png" alt="Package" align="right" height="96" width="96" />I added most of the iLife applications to our base image today, and received the error:
<blockquote>installer: Error - You are attempting an unsupported installation. If you wish to install an individual application, please use the iLife installer and select the Custom button.</blockquote>
However, using the CM_BUILD environmental variable, I'm able to install packages via the command line from the Mac OS X second DVD that ships with all new machines.  For example:
<pre class="code">export CM_BUILD=CM_BUILD</pre>
If you need to install packages to an alternate volume, say another machine booted in Firewire Target Mode, or a disk image, then you might want to enable the CM_BUILD option.

I'm not entirely sure what CM_BUILD stands for, but I got the idea from the Mac OS X chroot installation HOWTO documents floating around.
